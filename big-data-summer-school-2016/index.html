OpenDroneMap is an open source toolkit for aerial drone imagery. It is modern photogrammetry - fully automated matching, digital surface model, and mosaicking, including stitching and blending.

I have my grandfather's axe. It has had its handle and head replaced...

# OpenDroneMap

OpenDroneMap is a tool to postprocess drone, balloon, kite, and street view data to geographic data including:

* orthophotos
* point clouds
* textured mesh

# Image input assumptions

* JPEG / RGB
* High level of overlap and sidelap
  * 80%+ overlap

## Technical dive
* ### Underlying approaches
  * #### Structure from Motion (SfM)
  * #### Dense point cloud creation
  * #### Mesh Generation
  * #### Texturing / Blending
  * #### Ortho photo creation

# Dense point cloud creation

* Currently PMVS / CMVS (https://www.di.ens.fr/cmvs/)
* Moving to Semi-global matching
  * Questions:
    * Custom development?
    * Use (AGPL-licensed OpenMVS)?
