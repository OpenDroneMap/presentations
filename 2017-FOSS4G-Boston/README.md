# GeoSpatial outputs from flying robots: drone construction through photogrammetric alchemy

## Description:
OpenDroneMap is free and open source photogrammetry toolkit targeted at lo flying aircraft imagery processing. OpenDroneMap has made great strides in the last few years toward feature parity with closed-source commercial software. New advancements this year are moving beyond feature parity into implentation state-of-the-art algorithms, processing workflows, and the real promise of FOSS photogrammetry -- massive scaling potential.
This workshop is a combined software / hardware hacking session. As such, the first half of the workshop is focused on the construction of an inexpensive but professional quality drone for mapping. The drone will be capable of being manually controlled or fully auto-piloted. As a class, will do a single demonstration build, but participants are encouraged to bring their own drone parts. A build parts list will be distributed to participants prior to the workshop.
The second half of the workshop focuses on software processing of images from the drone in order to make usable as geospatial datasets. We'll take users through installation and use of OpenDroneMap, WebODM, and the processing of datasets, settings, and options therein, and discuss and demonstrate options for hosted and scalable OpenDroneMap solutions.
